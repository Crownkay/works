                        n the paragraph above, the first letter of the text is embedded in a span element.
                        The span element has a width that is 0.7 times the size of the current font.
                        The font-size of the span element is 400% (quite large) and the line-height is 80%.
                        The font of the letter in the span will be in "Algerian".
                        Notice we have put a clearfix on the div container. It is not needed in this example, but it would be if the nav element was longer than the non-floated section content.</p>
